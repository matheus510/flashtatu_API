# Flashtatu 0.0.2

### Introduction

This is a API that will be further used on Flashtatu platform. It will manages all bussiness logic and data persistence. Ideally, it will be based on SOLID principles, trying to follow [node best practices](https://github.com/i0natan/nodebestpractices) towards componentization.

The main focus of this version is to apply all best practices that were left behind on the first prototype. ES6, automated tests, precommit checks (husky).
